On the platform, a young man was standing on the platform, wearing a T-shirt and with a suitcase and a large bag, the same as almost everyone else on the platform. Because it was July, and everyone was going on vacation to the famous Wet Beach in the country. That young man’s name was George Nautilus, a detective, but now in the holidays, and going to West Beach for vacation the same as the rest of the others.
“On platform 3 is the 7:00 Nationwide Railway Express service to West Beach, this train is formed of 20 coaches. Due to the short platform, passengers going to Green Mountain Station and Hillvert Station should board the 6 front coaches. Please mind the gap and enjoy the journey with Nationwide Railway service.” the speaker on the platform announced.
Then, the train arrived, and everyone boarded. This train was going to West Beach Station, a wonderful place for vacation in a sizzling summer, and there were also whales in the bay areas, which was perfect for taking photos. The reason George went there was also because he wanted to do some photographing during the holidays when he had no cases to solve and could relax for some time, just if he did not run into any cases, he jokingly thought. 
George boarded the train, and he was sitting in a first-class window seat at coach 1, just enjoying the beautiful scenery, but he still could not get his mind away from the last case he solved. The last case he solved was at a party in a hotel, a friend of George invited him there, at there, he accidentally ran into another party and there he saw someone got killed. 
He quickly called the police and then started solving the case, that dead person was killed by poison in syringe, that syringe was covered by a handkerchief that the founder of the party given to everyone that went to the party. There were multiple colors of handkerchiefs, and every 7 people have the same color, so the suspects were that 7 people, there was also another clue, the couple pictures of the party at the time. 
Those pictures did not capture the killer kill that person, so at first George did not care about these pictures and wanted to solve the case by comparing the fingerprints on the handkerchief. But the police only find the fingerprints of the staff that gave the handkerchiefs out, so this would be a dead end for George. Then George thought of asking was there any witnessers of the killer killing, but the participants there were not that patient at all and refused to answer the questions. The participants also yelled at George and the police to let George and the police to open the door and let them go away and not waste their time. 
But George still thought of a way to get them some time, but a very risky plan, he would take a gamble with the participants that he would solve the case within 20 minutes. If he failed, everyone could leave, but if he found out who killed that person everyone had to give him 10 dollars, and everyone agreed with him. 
So, he started his work, first, he looked at all the pictures of the party, but he still could not find anything useful, so he went on to the next step. Next, George asked all the participants with the handkerchief that had the same color on the dead person raise theirs, George should do this earlier, but he somehow forgot to do this. Soon, 6 people raised their handkerchiefs, but after they lowered their handkerchiefs, the final person raised his hand with a handkerchief. He explained that he could not find his handkerchief and had to find it for a moment, so he was late when he raised his hand, but he was too scared to say it. George did not suspect anything, then, George asked them to say where were them when the dead person was killed, the time the dead person died also was a high point of the party, so everyone probably knew where them at that time were. 
There were a lot of people at the party, so the killer could not move very fat to get to the location to kill the dead person, but if they lie, they will get found by other people. Surprised at George, all the suspects were all relatively near to the dead person, and no one said they were lying, so George could not get any useful information out of this.
After that, George decided to play the mental game, he first let all the people stand in the circle, with George in the center. Then he said he almost knew who the killer was, but he still needed one more clue to know who it was. So, he let everyone open their hands and George pretended to be looking at their hands, but he was looking at their faces to see who he was fearing. But by the time, the people most frightened were the police, they were all shocked by George's audacity, and they kept sweating, some of the police tried to stop George, but no one could stop him. 
George continued to look at their faces, finally he finished looking, and he found 4 people that did not look good. 2 of them had the correct handkerchief, so George let them step ahead and said 1 of these 2 people was the killer, and he needed just a couple moments to find out who was the killer. By this time, only 3 minutes was remaining, but George still did not know who the killer was, he started to look again on all the clues he had gotten. He looked at the syringe, he could not find anything useful. He looked at the handkerchief, but he still could not find anything useful. 
Then he thought up something, the 7 people that had the same handkerchief color of the one on the dead person, they said their location to George. They were standing quite close to each other, so what if at the time they were doing something together and could proof the other one was not the killer. But after thinking though this, George thought it was not possible, because they never talked to each other, and they looked like they had never met before.
